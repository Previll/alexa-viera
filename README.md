# Alexa Viera

An Alexa skill to control my TV.

This isn't currently a public skill, hence the sparse documentation.

## Set up

Make a copy of `config.example.json` named `config.json`. Put your
API key, app ID and server address in there.

Run `npm install`, then zip it up and upload it to AWS Lambda.
